    <h2>What is a coronavirus?</h2>
    <p>
      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause disease in both
      animals and humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause
      respiratory infections that can range from the common cold to more serious
      illnesses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered
      coronavirus causes COVID-19 coronavirus disease.
    </p>

    <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>
      COVID-19 is the most recently discovered infectious disease caused by the
      coronavirus. Both the new virus and the disease were unknown before the
      outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>
      The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat,
      or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and appear gradually. Some
      people become infected but do not develop any symptoms and are not sick.
      Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without any special
      treatment. About 1 in 6 people who get IDOC-19 develop a serious illness
      and have difficulty breathing. Older people and those with underlying
      medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart problems, or
      diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people
      who have contracted the disease have died. People who have a fever, cough,
      and shortness of breath should seek medical attention.
    </p>
    <h2>Protective measures for all persons</h2>
    <p>
      Keep up to date with the latest information on the outbreak of COVID-19,
      which can be accessed on the WHO website and through relevant public
      health authorities at national and local levels. Cases have been reported
      in many countries around the world, and several have experienced
      outbreaks. Authorities in China and other countries have managed to slow
      or stop the progress of outbreaks, but the situation is unpredictable and
      the latest news needs to be checked regularly.
      <br />
      There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce the
      likelihood of contracting or spreading IDOC-19:
    </p>
    <h3>Wash your hands frequently</h3>
    <p>
      Wash your hands often with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and
      water.
      <br />
      <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with an alcohol-based hand
      sanitizer or soap and water kills the virus if it is on your hands.

      measures
    </h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">
      When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow
      or a tissue; throw the tissue away immediately and wash your hands with an
      alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">
      <strong>Why?</strong> Covering your mouth and nose during a cough or
      sneeze prevents the spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough
      into your hands, you can contaminate the objects or people you touch.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">
      Keep at least 3 feet away from others, particularly those who cough,
      sneeze and have a fever.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">
      <strong>Why?</strong> When someone with a respiratory illness, such as
      2019-nCoV infection, coughs or sneezes, it projects tiny droplets
      containing the virus. If they are too close, they can inhale the virus.

      eyes, nose and mouth
    </h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">
      <strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces that may be contaminated
      with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your
      contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to
      yourself.

      attention early
    </h3>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">
      Tell your health care provider if you have traveled to an area of China
      where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have had close contact with
      someone who has traveled from China and has respiratory symptoms.
    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">
      <strong>Why?</strong> Whenever you have a fever, cough and difficulty
      breathing, it is important to seek medical attention immediately, as these
      symptoms may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition.
      Respiratory symptoms with fever can have several causes, and depending on
      your travel history and personal circumstances, 2019-nCoV may be one of
      them.
